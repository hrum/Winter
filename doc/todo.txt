- think on buildings
- each building may change income and/or consumption

- make buildings more random
- player should use dices when build it
- buildings may be risky
- use three zones: green, yellow, red?
- player uses energy to re-roll dices
- one roll for both income and consumption
- remove consumption at all

- each player takes inspection card

=================================================

- make consumption to be different for each player
- make it just gold and energy
- use tokens for gold and energy

- create prototype
- test prototype
- write feedback
